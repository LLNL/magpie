# Magpie job type
#
# "hadoop" - Run a job according to the settings of HADOOP_MODE.
#
# "hbase" - Run a job according to the settings of HBASE_MODE.
#
# "pig" - Run a job according to the settings of PIG_MODE.
#
# "spark" - Run a job according to the settings of SPARK_MODE.
#
# "storm" - Run a job according to the settings of STORM_MODE.
#
# "zookeeper" - Run a job according to the settings of ZOOKEEPER_MODE.
#
# "testall" - Run a job that runs all basic sanity tests for all
#             software that is configured to be setup.  This is a good
#             way to sanity check that everything has been setup
#             correctly and the way you like.
#
#             For Hadoop, testall will run terasort
#             For Hbase, testall will run performanceeval
#             For Pig, testall will run testpig
#             For Spark, testall will run sparkpi
#             For Storm, testall will run stormwordcount
#             For Zookeeper, testall will run zookeeperruok
#
# "script" - Run an arbitraty script, as specified by
#            MAGPIE_SCRIPT_PATH.  This functionally is very similar to
#            setting "script" in HADOOP_MODE or HBASE_MODE or
#            SPARK_MODE or STORM_MODE.
#
#            It is primarily used if you want to launch without
#            Hadoop/Hbase/Spark/Storm (such as Zookeeper only) and are
#            experimenting with things..
#
# "interactive" - manually interact with job run.  This functionally
#                 is very similar to setting "interactive" in
#                 HADOOP_MODE, HBASE_MODE, SPARK_MODE, STORM_MODE, or
#                 PIG_MODE.  It is primarily used if you want to

#
# Specifies the amount of time to give startup / shutdown activities a
# chance to succeed before Magpie will give up (or in the case of
# shutdown, when the resource manager/scheduler may kill the running
# job).  Defaults to 30 minutes for startup, 30 minutes for shutdown.
#
# The startup time in particular may need to be increased if you have
# a large amount of data.  As an example, HDFS may need to spend a
# significant amount of time determine all of the blocks in HDFS
# before leaving safemode.
#
# The stop time in particular may need to be increased if you have a
# large amount of cleanup to be done.  HDFS will save its NameSpace
# before shutting down.  Hbase will do a compaction before shutting
# down.
#
# The startup & shutdown window must together be smaller than the
# SBATCH_TIMELIMIT specified above.
#
# MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME and MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME at minimum must be 5

# Convenience Scripts
#
# Specify script to be executed to before / after your job.  It is run
# on all nodes.
#
# Typically the pre-job script is used to set something up or get
# debugging info.  It can also be used to determine if system
# conditions meet the expectations of your job.  The primary job
# running script (magpie-run) will not be executed if the
# MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN exits with a non-zero exit code.
#
# The post-job script is typically used for cleaning up something or
# gathering info (such as logs) for post-debugging/analysis.  If it is
# set, MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME above must be > 5.

# Hbase Job/Run Configurations
############################################################################

# Set how Hbase should run
#
# "performanceeval" - run performance evaluation write and read.
#              Useful for making sure things are setup the way you
#              like.
#
#              Configure run with HBASE_PERFORMANCEEVAL_MODE,
#              HBASE_PERFORMANCEEVAL_ROW_COUNT, and
#              HBASE_PERFORMANCEEVAL_CLIENT_COUNT.
#
# "script" - execute a script that lists all of your Hbase jobs.  Be
#            sure to set HBASE_SCRIPT_PATH to your script.
#
# "interactive" - manually interact to submit jobs, peruse Hbase, etc.
#                 In this mode you'll login to the cluster node that
#                 is your 'master' node and interact with Hbase
#                 directly (e.g. bin/hbase ...)
#
# "setuponly" - Like 'interactive' but only setup conf files. useful
#               if user wants to setup daemons themselves, etc.
#
export HBASE_MODE="performanceeval"

# Should a major compaction be done when Hbase is being shut down.  In
# general, this is something that should be done to compact small
# files, remove flagged deletes, etc., but could take a long time.
# MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME should be large enough to handle this.
#
# This can also be run via the convenience script
# hbase-major-compaction.sh.
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to yes.
# export HBASE_MAJOR_COMPACTION_ON_SHUTDOWN=yes

# Hbase Performance Evaluation Configurations
############################################################################

# Performance Evaluation Mode
#
# Specify 'sequential-thread' for threaded sequential write/read 
# Specify 'sequential-mr' for MapReduce sequential write/read
# Specify 'random-thread' for threaded random write/read 
# Specify 'random-mr' for MapReduce random write/read
#
# Defaults to 'sequential-thread' if not specified. 
# 
# export HBASE_PERFORMANCEEVAL_MODE="sequential-thread"

# Performance Evaluation Rows
#
# For "performanceeval" mode.  Rows each client will run.
#
# Defaults to 1048576 (1 million)
#
# export HBASE_PERFORMANCEEVAL_ROW_COUNT=1048576

# Performance Evaluation client count
#
# For "performanceeval" mode.
#
# If not specified, defaults to 1.
#
# export HBASE_PERFORMANCEEVAL_CLIENT_COUNT=1

############################################################################
# Hbase Script Configurations
############################################################################

# Specify script to execute for "script" mode
#
# See hbase-example-job-script for example of what to put in the script.
#
# export HBASE_SCRIPT_PATH="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/my-job-script"

############################################################################
# Zookeeper Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Zookeeper be run
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to no.
# 
export ZOOKEEPER_SETUP=yes

# Zookeeper Replication Count
#
# Recommended to be odd.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_REPLICATION_COUNT=3

# Zookeeper Node Sharing
#
# By default, Zookeeper will not run on nodes that will run Hadoop/Hbase.
# They will have dedicated nodes for themselves.  If you do not wish
# for this to be the case, set the below to 'yes'.  Defaults to no.
#
# Keep in mind that adjustments to the number of nodes in your
# allocation may need to be adjusted given your setting of this
# parameter.  For example, if you want 8 nodes for Hadoop processing,
# you should increase your allocation by ZOOKEEPER_REPLICATION_COUNT
# if the below is 'no'.
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_SHARE_NODES=yes

# Set how Zookeeper should run
#
# "zookeeperruok" - Run a quick sanity test to see that zookeeper is
#             setup correctly.  zookeeperruok will do a simple 'ruok'
#             to all Zookeeper daemons.
#
# "launch" - Magpie will launch Zookeeper daemons
#
# "setuponly" - Only setup conf files. useful if user wants to setup
#               daemons themselves, etc.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_MODE="launch"

# Zookeeper Version
#
export ZOOKEEPER_VERSION="3.4.5"

# Path to your Zookeeper build/binaries
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_HOME="/home/username/zookeeper-${ZOOKEEPER_VERSION}"

# Directory where Zookeeper configuration templates are stored
#
# If not specified, assumed to be $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_CONF_FILES="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/conf"

# Set how Zookeeper data directory should be setup.
#
# "networkfs" - ZOOKEEPER_DATA_DIR points to a network filesystem
#               (such as Lustre).  Zookeeper local paths will be
#               setup.
#
# "local" - ZOOKEEPER_DATA_DIR points to a local drive.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_FILESYSTEM_MODE="networkfs"

# Path base for local data to each cluster node
#
# If ZOOKEEPER_FILESYSTEM_MODE is set to "networkfs", this is the base
# point for local data and per-node directories will be created
# (e.g. ${ZOOKEEPER_DATA_DIR}/node-1/)
#
# If you have local SSDs stored on the nodes of your system, it may be
# in your interest to set this to a local drive and adjust
# ZOOKEEPER_FILESYSTEM_MODE above to 'local'.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_DATA_DIR="/lustre/username/zookeeper"  

# Path local to each cluster node, typically something in /tmp.
# This will store local conf files and log files for your job. 
#
export ZOOKEEPER_LOCAL_DIR="/tmp/username/zookeeper"

# ZooKeeper ticktime, measured in milliseconds.  Used by all of
# Zookeeper for time measurement.
#
# Defaults to 2000.
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_TICKTIME=2000

# ZooKeeper initLimit, multiple of ticks to allow followers to connect
# and sync to a leader.  May need to increase this value if the data
# managed by ZooKeeper is large.
#
# Defaults to 10
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_INITLIMIT=10

# ZooKeeper syncLimit, multiple of ticks to allow followers to sync
# with ZooKeeper.  If they fall too far behind a leader, they will be
# dropped.
#
# Defaults to 5
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_SYNCLIMIT=5
