HDFS Federation
---------------

Experimentally, Magpie supports HDFS federation.

The submission scripts do not include HDFS federation configuration
fields by default.  To include them:

cd submission-scripts/script-templates
edit Makefile and set INSERT_HDFS_FEDERATION to 'y'
run 'make'

Tips & Tricks

HADOOP-8299)
