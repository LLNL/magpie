Intel Lustre Plugin
-------------------

Intel supports a Lustre plugin for Hadoop, however that plugin is
currently only available in their distribution of Hadoop or a code
plugin that can only be requested from them directly (i.e. it's not
open source).

The plugin is supported in Magpie via the 'intellustre' Hadoop file
system option.

The submission scripts do not include 'intellustre' configuration
fields by default.  To include them:

cd submission-scripts/script-templates
edit Makefile and set INSERT_INTELLUSTRE to 'y'
run 'make'
