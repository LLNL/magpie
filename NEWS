Magpie 2.0
----------

Magpie 2.0 includes new software support, but primarily involves a
large amount of re-architecture and removal of legacy experimental
support.  Job submission scripts from Magpie 1.X versions will be
incompatible with Magpie 2.0.  So please read details below for
highlights.

New Support

o Support Hadoop version 3

  - Support new HADOOP_WORKER_COUNT & HADOOP_WORKER_CORE_COUNT
    environment variables.

  - Update default Hadoop version to 3.1.1.

o Support Hive, initially with Hive v2.3.0

Re-architecture and changes

o Rearchitect MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE to be overarching job configuration
  variable.

  - "setuponly" and "interactive" jobs are now configured by
    MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE and not through any of the former "MODE" variables
    (e.g. HADOOP_MODE, SPARK_MODE, etc.)

  - Generic "script" jobs are now configured by MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE and
    not through any of the former "MODE" variables.
    (e.g. HADOOP_MODE, SPARK_MODE, etc.)

    However, "script" is still available for those projects that run a
    script through a specific service, e.g. PIG and PHOENIX.

o Rearchitect HADOOP_SETUP_TYPE to be version agnostic.  It now takes
  "MR", "YARN", or "HDFS" as inputs.

  - A new submission script variant to support Spark w/ Yarn and w/o
    HDFS is now available.

o "MODE" variables (e.g. HADOOP_MODE, SPARK_MODE, etc.) are now named
  "JOB" (e.g. HADOOP_JOB, SPARK_JOB, etc.).  This change was done to
  indicate that they truly only run jobs and are not meant for
  configuring the project in any way.

  - As a result the following configurations have been removed.

    "launch" from HADOOP_JOB
    "hdfsonly" from HADOOP_JOB
    "server" from KAFKA_JOB
    "server" from PHOENIX_JOB
    "launch" from ZOOKEEPER_JOB
    "server" from ZEPPELIN_JOB

  - The Phoenix mode "server" is now available through the
    configuration variable PHOENIX_START_QUERYSERVER.

o SPARK_USE_YARN has been removed and replaced with SPARK_SETUP_TYPE
  with settings options of "STANDALONE" or "YARN".

o HADOOP_PER_JOB_HDFS_PATH and ZOOKEEPER_PER_JOB_DATA_DIR have been
  removed, the behavior has been collapsed into MAGPIE_ONE_TIME_RUN.

o Remove experimental features and experimental/non-heavily used
  projects.  If you wish for these features to be brought back beyond
  an 'experimental' nature, please submit an issue request.  Features
  & projects listed below.

  - Hadoop 1.X versions
  - Tachyon
  - UDA
  - 'MagpieNetworkFS' Filesystem
  - 'IntelLustre' Filesystem
  - HDFS Federation

o Older "quirky" version numbers in Hadoop (e.g. 0.21.0 in Hadoop) are
  no longer supported.

o Older legacy MAGPIE_SUBMISSION_TYPE values no longer support
  (slurmsbatch, msubslurm, msubtorque).  Users should convert to the
  newer values of sbatchsrun, msubslurmsrun, msubtorquepdsh.

o Older legacy support of setting SBATCH_TIMELIMIT or
  MAGPIE_TIMELIMIT_MINUTES in scripts removed.  Users should set job
  time length using normal submission mechanisms (e.g. --time via
  sbatch).

o Older legacy support of HADOOP_RAWNETWORKFS_BLOCKSIZE is no longer
  supported.  Users should use HADOOP_LOCAL_FILESYSTEM_BLOCKSIZE.

Misc Features & Changes

- Support new MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD_MAP and
  MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_SCHEDULER_MAP configuration.  These variables allow
  users to configure a mechanism to "map" the hostname/nodenames that
  come from the 'hostname' command or scheduler to another value.
  This can be useful in unique environments where the output of the
  'hostname' command does not map to the nodenames configured into the
  scheduler/resource manager and when the scheduler/resource manager
  does not indicate which host/address/interface Magpie should
  actually configure.

- MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN and MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN can have multiple scripts
  listed by comma.

- MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN and MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN can have arguments passed
  to each script.

- MAGPIE_SCRIPT_PATH and MAGPIE_SCRIPT_ARGS have been collapsed into
  one environment variable MAGPIE_JOB_SCRIPT.

- magpie-gather-config-files-and-logs-script.sh: Takes an argument to
  store log files to an alternate location other than $HOME.

- Default HDFS namenode port is now 8020 instead of 54310

- Update default Java to 1.8 in submission scripts.

Misc Documentation Changes

- No longer list support for versions that require re-compilation.

- No longer list support for versions that are not included in Magpie
  testsuite.

Backwards Compatibility Notes

o The following are possible changes users may need to make in older
  job submission scripts.

  - "MODE" variables (e.g. HADOOP_MODE, SPARK_MODE, etc.) are now
    named "JOB" (e.g. HADOOP_JOB, SPARK_JOB, etc.).

  - "JOB" variables no longer support "interactive" or "setuponly"
    options.  These are now controlled via MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE.

  - "JOB" variables no longer support "server", "launch", or
    "hdfsonly" options.  A service "launching" is always assumed
    unless MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE is set to "setuponly".

  - Many "JOB" variables no longer support "script" options, these are
    done via MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE.

  - "PHOENIX_MODE"'s "server" option is now configured through
    PHOENIX_START_QUERYSERVER.

  - HADOOP_SETUP_TYPE no longer takes input of "MR1", "MR2", "HDFS1",
    or "HDFS2".  It now only takes "MR", "YARN", or "HDFS".

  - SPARK_USE_YARN is now configured through SPARK_SETUP_TYPE.

  - HADOOP_FILESYSTEM_MODE no longer takes input of "magpienetworkfs"
    or "intellustre".

  - MAGPIE_SCRIPT_PATH and MAGPIE_SCRIPT_ARGS should be converted to
    MAGPIE_JOB_SCRIPT.

Major refactoring and code cleanup within Magpie.

Years of adding features, adding projects, cutting & pasting,
experiments, and patches have run its course for a set of "play
scripts" that were originally only to support Hadoop 1.0.  A major
refactoring & code cleanup was needed.

Apologies to anyone anyone looking through the git log.  One tiny
cleanup beget another one.  For all intents and purposes, you should
consider the scripts to have stopped at tag 1.73 and started anew at
tag 1.74.

Highlights:

- General code cleanup throughout: function-ize common code, split
  functions into different lib files to remove dependencies, split up
  large files into project specific ones, remove strange dependencies
  in different files, rename files to make more sense, rename
  variables to be consistent, rename functions to indicate "public" vs
  "private" ones, add consistency to error messages, cleanup help
  output, add "assert" checks in various locations with dependencies,
  consistent file creation of masters & slaves files, do not export
  variables that aren't required to be exported, fix a variety of
  deprecated situations, fix outputs that go into
  MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT, fix inconsistencies on support
  in various MODE options, move various files into subdirs to cleanup
  number of files in a single dir.

- Attempt to be consistent with use of Bash code style throughout.
  e.g. using backticks instead of $() for subshells.

  In an attempt to avoid flame wars on style decisions, I simply
  looked at what had been most commonly done thus far and used those
  styles.

- Support 'setuponly' option for PHOENIX_MODE.

- Fix many minor corner cases

- Add many additional corner case checks

- Testsuite

  - Add large suite of corner case tests & functionality tests

- New exports

  Export ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT for jobs.
  Export KAFKA_PORT for jobs.

- Potential compatibility issues with older job submission scripts:

  Before, a number of variables were errantly exported.  Most notably
  port numbers and such that should have only been used internally
  within Magpie.  If by chance you used one of these environment
  variables in scripts, you may need to adjust for it.

  Hadoop terasort may no longer do the "right" thing under Hadoop 1.0.
  Users should set HADOOP_TERAGEN_MAP_COUNT and
  HADOOP_TERASORT_REDUCER_COUNT appropriately.

  Remove scripts/job-scripts/zookeeper-ruok-script.sh script

- Potential issues if you scripted against the Magpie code base

  Rename start/stop scripts in bin/ for consistency to many big data
  projects.

  Files in conf/ are now stored in subdirectories.  So paths may have
  changed.

  Rename some conf files in conf/.

  Rename a number of patches for consistency.
