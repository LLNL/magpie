Magpie
------

Magpie contains a number of scripts for running Big Data software in
HPC environments.  Thus far, Hadoop, Spark, Hbase, Storm, Pig, Mahout,
Phoenix, Kafka, Tachyon, Zeppelin, and Zookeeper are supported.  It
currently supports running over the parallel file system Lustre and
running over any generic network filesytem.  There is
scheduler/resource manager support for Slurm, Moab, Torque, and LSF.

Some of the features presently supported:

- Run jobs interactively or via scripts.
- Run Mapreduce 1.0 or 2.0 jobs via Hadoop 1.0 or 2.0
- Run against a number of filesystem options, such as HDFS, HDFS over
  Lustre, HDFS over a generic network filesystem, Lustre directly, or
  a generic network filesystem.
- Take advantage of SSDs/NVRAM for local caching if available
- Run the UDA Infiniband optimization plugin for Hadoop.
- Make decent optimizations for your hardware

Basic Idea
----------

The basic idea behind these scripts are to:

1) Submit a Magpie batch script to allocate nodes on a cluster using
   your HPC scheduler/resource manager.  Slurm, Moab+Slurm,
   Moab+Torque and LSF+mpirun are currently supported.

2) The batch script will create configuration files for all
   appropriate projects (Hadoop, Spark, etc.)  The configuration files
   will be setup so the rank 0 node is the "master".  All compute
   nodes will have configuration files created that point to the node
   designated as the master server.

   The configuration files will be populated with values for your
   filesystem choice and the hardware that exists in your cluster.
   Reasonable attempts are made to determine optimal values for your
   system and hardware (they are almost certainly better than the
   default values).  A number of options exist in the batch scripts to
   adjust these values for individual jobs.

3) Launch daemons on all nodes.  The rank 0 node will run master
   daemons, such as the Hadoop Namenode.  All remaining nodes will run
   appropriate slave daemons, such as the Hadoop Datanodes.

4) Now you have a mini big data cluster to do whatever you want.  You
   can log into the master node and interact with your mini big data
   cluster however you want.  Or you could have Magpie run a script to
   execute your big data calculation instead.

5) When your job completes or your allocation time has run out, Magpie
   will cleanup your job by tearing down daemons.  When appropriate,
   Magpie may also do some additional cleanup work to hopefully make
   re-execution on later runs cleaner and faster.

Supported Packages & Versions
-----------------------------

The following packages and their versions have been tested for minimal
support in Magpie.  Please see full README for additional details.

      environment.

[TachyonNote] - Default Tachyon build is against Hadoop 1.0.4 and
      Spark may be built against non-0.6.X builds.  Recompilation of
      Tachyon & Spark may be needed depending on your environment.
