# Magpie job type
#
# "hadoop" - Run a job according to the settings of HADOOP_MODE.
#
# "hbase" - Run a job according to the settings of HBASE_MODE.
#
# "pig" - Run a job according to the settings of PIG_MODE.
#
# "spark" - Run a job according to the settings of SPARK_MODE.
#
# "storm" - Run a job according to the settings of STORM_MODE.
#
# "zookeeper" - Run a job according to the settings of ZOOKEEPER_MODE.
#
# "testall" - Run a job that runs all basic sanity tests for all
#             software that is configured to be setup.  This is a good
#             way to sanity check that everything has been setup
#             correctly and the way you like.
#
#             For Hadoop, testall will run terasort
#             For Hbase, testall will run performanceeval
#             For Pig, testall will run testpig
#             For Spark, testall will run sparkpi
#             For Storm, testall will run stormwordcount
#             For Zookeeper, testall will run zookeeperruok
#
# "script" - Run an arbitraty script, as specified by
#            MAGPIE_SCRIPT_PATH.  This functionally is very similar to
#            setting "script" in HADOOP_MODE or HBASE_MODE or
#            SPARK_MODE or STORM_MODE.
#
#            It is primarily used if you want to launch without
#            Hadoop/Hbase/Spark/Storm (such as Zookeeper only) and are
#            experimenting with things..
#
# "interactive" - manually interact with job run.  This functionally
#                 is very similar to setting "interactive" in
#                 HADOOP_MODE, HBASE_MODE, SPARK_MODE, STORM_MODE, or
#                 PIG_MODE.  It is primarily used if you want to

#
# Specifies the amount of time to give startup / shutdown activities a
# chance to succeed before Magpie will give up (or in the case of
# shutdown, when the resource manager/scheduler may kill the running
# job).  Defaults to 30 minutes for startup, 30 minutes for shutdown.
#
# The startup time in particular may need to be increased if you have
# a large amount of data.  As an example, HDFS may need to spend a
# significant amount of time determine all of the blocks in HDFS
# before leaving safemode.
#
# The stop time in particular may need to be increased if you have a
# large amount of cleanup to be done.  HDFS will save its NameSpace
# before shutting down.  Hbase will do a compaction before shutting
# down.
#
# The startup & shutdown window must together be smaller than the
# SBATCH_TIMELIMIT specified above.
#
# MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME and MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME at minimum must be 5

# Convenience Scripts
#
# Specify script to be executed to before / after your job.  It is run
# on all nodes.
#
# Typically the pre-job script is used to set something up or get
# debugging info.  It can also be used to determine if system
# conditions meet the expectations of your job.  The primary job
# running script (magpie-run) will not be executed if the
# MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN exits with a non-zero exit code.
#
# The post-job script is typically used for cleaning up something or
# gathering info (such as logs) for post-debugging/analysis.  If it is
# set, MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME above must be > 5.
