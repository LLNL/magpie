# Zookeeper Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Zookeeper be run
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to no.
# 
export ZOOKEEPER_SETUP=no

# Zookeeper Replication Count
#
# Recommended to be odd.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_REPLICATION_COUNT=3

# Zookeeper Node Sharing
#
# By default, Zookeeper will not run on nodes that will run Hadoop/Hbase.
# They will have dedicated nodes for themselves.  If you do not wish
# for this to be the case, set the below to 'yes'.  Defaults to no.
#
# Keep in mind that adjustments to the number of nodes in your
# allocation may need to be adjusted given your setting of this
# parameter.  For example, if you want 8 nodes for Hadoop processing,
# you should increase your allocation by ZOOKEEPER_REPLICATION_COUNT
# if the below is 'no'.
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_SHARE_NODES=yes

# Set how Zookeeper should run
#
# "zookeeperruok" - Run a quick sanity test to see that zookeeper is
#             setup correctly.  zookeeperruok will do a simple 'ruok'
#             to all Zookeeper daemons.
#
# "launch" - Magpie will launch Zookeeper daemons
#
# "setuponly" - Only setup conf files. useful if user wants to setup
#               daemons themselves, etc.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_MODE="launch"

# Zookeeper Version
#
export ZOOKEEPER_VERSION="3.4.6"

# Path to your Zookeeper build/binaries
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_HOME="/home/username/zookeeper-${ZOOKEEPER_VERSION}"

# Directory where Zookeeper configuration templates are stored
#
# If not specified, assumed to be $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_CONF_FILES="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/conf"

# Set how Zookeeper data directory should be setup.
#
# "networkfs" - ZOOKEEPER_DATA_DIR points to a network filesystem
#               (such as Lustre).  Zookeeper local paths will be
#               setup.
#
# "local" - ZOOKEEPER_DATA_DIR points to a local drive.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_FILESYSTEM_MODE="networkfs"

# Path base for local data to each cluster node
#
# If ZOOKEEPER_FILESYSTEM_MODE is set to "networkfs", this is the base
# point for local data and per-node directories will be created
# (e.g. ${ZOOKEEPER_DATA_DIR}/node-1/)
#
# If you have local SSDs stored on the nodes of your system, it may be
# in your interest to set this to a local drive and adjust
# ZOOKEEPER_FILESYSTEM_MODE above to 'local'.
#
export ZOOKEEPER_DATA_DIR="/lustre/username/zookeeper"  

# Path local to each cluster node, typically something in /tmp.
# This will store local conf files and log files for your job. 
#
export ZOOKEEPER_LOCAL_DIR="/tmp/username/zookeeper"

# ZooKeeper ticktime, measured in milliseconds.  Used by all of
# Zookeeper for time measurement.
#
# Defaults to 2000.
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_TICKTIME=2000

# ZooKeeper initLimit, multiple of ticks to allow followers to connect
# and sync to a leader.  May need to increase this value if the data
# managed by ZooKeeper is large.
#
# Defaults to 10
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_INITLIMIT=10

# ZooKeeper syncLimit, multiple of ticks to allow followers to sync
# with ZooKeeper.  If they fall too far behind a leader, they will be
# dropped.
#
# Defaults to 5
#
# export ZOOKEEPER_SYNCLIMIT=5
