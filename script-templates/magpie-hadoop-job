# Hadoop Job/Run Configurations
############################################################################

# Set how Hadoop should run
#
# "terasort" - run terasort.  Useful for making sure things are setup
#              the way you like.
#
#              There are additional configuration options for this
#              example listed below.
#
# "script" - execute a script that lists all of your Hadoop jobs.  Be
#            sure to set HADOOP_SCRIPT_PATH to your script.
#
# "interactive" - manually interact to submit jobs, peruse HDFS, etc.
#                 also useful for moving data in/out of HDFS.  In this
#                 mode you'll login to the cluster node that is your
#                 'master' node and interact with Hadoop directly
#                 (e.g. bin/hadoop ...)
#
# "upgradehdfs" - upgrade your version of HDFS.  Most notably this is
#                 used when you are switching to a newer Hadoop
#                 version and the HDFS version would be inconsistent
#                 without upgrading.  Only works with HDFS versions >=
#                 2.2.0.
#
#		  Beware, once you upgrade it'll be difficult to rollback.
#
# "setuponly" - Like 'interactive' but only setup conf files. useful
#               if user wants to setup daemons themselves, etc.
#
export HADOOP_MODE="terasort"
