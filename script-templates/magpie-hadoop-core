# Hadoop Core Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Hadoop be run
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to no.
# 
export HADOOP_SETUP=no

# Set Hadoop Setup Type
#
# Will inform scripts on how to setup config files and what daemons to
# launch/setup.  The hadoop build/binaries set by HADOOP_HOME
# needs to match up with what you set here.
#
# MR1 - MapReduce/Hadoop 1.0 w/ HDFS
# MR2 - MapReduce/Hadoop 2.0 w/ HDFS
# HDFS1 - HDFS only w/ Hadoop 1.0 
# HDFS2 - HDFS only w/ Hadoop 2.0
#
# The HDFS only options may be useful when you want to use HDFS with
# other big data software, such as Hbase, and do not care for using
# Hadoop MapReduce.  It only works with HDFS based
# HADOOP_FILESYSTEM_MODE, such as "hdfs", "hdfsoverlustre", or
# "hdfsovernetworkfs".
#
export HADOOP_SETUP_TYPE="MR2"

# Version
#
# Make sure the version for Mapreduce version 1 or 2 matches whatever
# you set in HADOOP_SETUP_TYPE
#
export HADOOP_VERSION="2.4.0"

# Path to your Hadoop build/binaries
#
# Make sure the build for MapReduce or HDFS version 1 or 2 matches
# whatever you set in HADOOP_SETUP_TYPE.
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
export HADOOP_HOME="/home/username/hadoop-${HADOOP_VERSION}"

# Path local to each cluster node, typically something in /tmp.
# This will store local conf files and log files for your job. 
#
# This will not be used for storing intermediate files or
# distributed cache files.  See HADOOP_LOCALSTORE above for that.
#
export HADOOP_LOCAL_DIR="/tmp/username/hadoop"

# Directory where Hadoop configuration templates are stored
#
# If not specified, assumed to be $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf
#
# export HADOOP_CONF_FILES="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/conf"

# Daemon Heap Max
#
# Heap maximum for Hadoop daemons (i.e. Resource Manger, NodeManager,
# DataNode, History Server, etc.), specified in megs.  Special case
# for Namenode, see below.
#
# If not specified, defaults to Hadoop default of 1000
#
# May need to be increased if you are scaling large, get OutofMemory
# errors, or perhaps have a lot of cores on a node.
#
# export HADOOP_DAEMON_HEAP_MAX=2000

# Daemon Namenode Heap Max
#
# Heap maximum for Hadoop Namenode daemons specified in megs.
#
# If not specified, defaults to HADOOP_DAEMON_HEAP_MAX above.
#
# Unlike most Hadoop daemons, namenode may need more memory if there
# are a very large number of files in your HDFS setup.  A general rule
# of thumb is a 1G heap for each 100T of data.
#
# export HADOOP_NAMENODE_DAEMON_HEAP_MAX=2000

# Environment Extra
#
# Specify extra environment information that should be passed into
# Hadoop.  This file will simply be appended into the hadoop-env.sh
# (and if appropriate) yarn-env.sh.
#
# By default, a reasonable estimate for max user processes and open
# file descriptors will be calculated and put into hadoop-env.sh (and
# if appropriate) yarn-env.sh.  However, it's always possible they may
# need to be set differently. Everyone's cluster/situation can be
# slightly different.
#
# See the example example-environment-extra extra for examples on
# what you can/should do with adding extra environment settings.
#
# export HADOOP_ENVIRONMENT_EXTRA_PATH="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/hadoop-my-environment"
