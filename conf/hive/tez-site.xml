    <description>String value to a file path.
 The location of the Tez libraries which will be localized for DAGs.
 This follows the following semantics
 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; To use .tar.gz or .tgz files (generated by the tez or hadoop builds), the full path to this
 file (including filename) should be specified. The internal structure of the uncompressed tgz
 will be defined by &apos;tez.lib.uris.classpath&apos;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; If a single file is specified without the above mentioned extensions - it will be treated as
 a regular file. This means it will not be uncompressed during runtime. &lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; If multiple entries exist
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Regular Files: will be treated as regular files (not uncompressed during runtime) &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Archive Files: will be treated as archives and will be uncompressed during runtime &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Directories: all files under the directory (non-recursive) will be made available (but not
 uncompressed during runtime). &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
