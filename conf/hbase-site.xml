  <property >
    <name>hbase.tmp.dir</name>
    <value>HBASETMPDIR</value>
    <description>Temporary directory on the local filesystem.
    Change this setting to point to a location more permanent
    than '/tmp', the usual resolve for java.io.tmpdir, as the
    '/tmp' directory is cleared on machine restart.</description>
  </property>
  <property >
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>HBASEROOTDIR</value>
    <description>The directory shared by region servers and into
    which HBase persists.  The URL should be 'fully-qualified'
    to include the filesystem scheme.  For example, to specify the
    HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is
    running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to:
    hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By default, we write
    to whatever ${hbase.tmp.dir} is set too -- usually /tmp --
    so change this configuration or else all data will be lost on
    machine restart.</description>
  </property>
  <property >
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are
      false for standalone mode and true for distributed mode.  If
      false, startup will run all HBase and ZooKeeper daemons together
      in the one JVM.</description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
    <value>HBASEZOOKEEPERQUORUM</value>
    <description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper ensemble
    (This config. should have been named hbase.zookeeper.ensemble).
    For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
    By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
    of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
    list of ZooKeeper ensemble servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
    this is the list of servers which hbase will start/stop ZooKeeper on as
    part of cluster start/stop.  Client-side, we will take this list of
    ensemble members and put it together with the hbase.zookeeper.clientPort
    config. and pass it into zookeeper constructor as the connectString
    parameter.</description>
  </property>

  <!-- Effectively disable major compaction by setting to 4 weeks,
  make user controled -->

  <property>
    <name>hbase.hregion.majorcompaction</name>
    <value>2419200000</value>
    <description>The time (in miliseconds) between 'major' compactions of all
    HStoreFiles in a region.  Default: Set to 7 days.  Major compactions tend to
    happen exactly when you need them least so enable them such that they run at
    off-peak for your deploy; or, since this setting is on a periodicity that is
    unlikely to match your loading, run the compactions via an external
    invocation out of a cron job or some such.</description>
