# Mahout Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Mahout be setup
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to no.
#
# Note that unlike Hadoop or Zookeeper, Mahout does not need to be
# enabled/disabled to be run with Hadoop.  For example, no daemons are setup.
#
# If MAHOUT_SETUP is enabled, this will inform Magpie to setup
# environment variables that will hopefully make it easier to run
# Mahout w/ Hadoop.  You could leave this disabled and setup/config
# Mahout as you need.
#
export MAHOUT_SETUP=no

# Mahout Version
#
export MAHOUT_VERSION="MAHOUTVERSIONDEFAULT"

# Path to your Mahout build/binaries
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
# Ensure the build matches the Hadoop version this will run against.
#
export MAHOUT_HOME="MAHOUTDIRPREFIX/apache-mahout-distribution-${MAHOUT_VERSION}"

# Path to store data local to each cluster node, typically something
# in /tmp.  This will store local conf files and log files for your
# job.  If local scratch space is not available, consider using the
# MAGPIE_NO_LOCAL_DIR_DIR option.  See README for more details.
#
export MAHOUT_LOCAL_DIR="LOCALDIRPREFIX/mahout"

# Set how Mahout should run
#
# "clustersyntheticcontrol" - Run the Mahout
#                             cluster-syntheticcontrol.sh example.  An
#                             internet connection outside of your
#                             cluster is required, as data will be
#                             downloaded for the test.
#
export MAHOUT_JOB="clustersyntheticcontrol"

# Mahout Opts
#
# Extra Java runtime options

# export MAHOUT_OPTS="-Djava.io.tmpdir=${MAHOUT_LOCAL_JOB_DIR}/tmp"
