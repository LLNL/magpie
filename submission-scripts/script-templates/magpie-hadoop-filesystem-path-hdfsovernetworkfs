# Networkfs path to do Hadoop HDFS out of
#
# Note that different versions of Hadoop may not be compatible with
# your current HDFS data.  If you're going to switch around to
# different versions, perhaps set different paths for different data.

# HDFS over Networkfs ignore lock
#
# Remove in_use.lock files before launching HDFS
#
# On traditional Hadoop clusters, the in_use.lock file protects
# against a second HDFS daemon running on the same node.  The lock
# file can similarly protect against a second HDFS daemon running on
# another node of your cluster.
#
# However, sometimes the lock file can be an annoyance.  If several
# nodes in your cluster die and you simply restart the job on
# separate nodes, the lock file may still be present and prohibit new
# HDFS daemons to run.
#
# By default, if this option is not set, the lock file will be left in
# place and may cause HDFS daemons to not start.  If set to yes, the
# lock files will be removed before starting HDFS.
