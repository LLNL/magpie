# Tachyon Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Tachyon be run
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to no.
#
export TACHYON_SETUP=no

# Set how Tachyon should run
#
# "testtachyon" - Run a quick sanity test to see that tachyon is
#             setup correctly.  testtachyon will do several simple filesystem
#             commands.
#
# "launch" - Magpie will launch Tachyon daemons
#
# "setuponly" - Like 'launch' but only setup conf files. useful
#               if user wants to setup & teardown daemons themselves.
#
export TACHYON_MODE="launch"

# Tachyon Version
#
export TACHYON_VERSION="TACHYONVERSIONDEFAULT"

# Path to your Tachyon build/binaries
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
export TACHYON_HOME="TACHYONDIRPREFIX/tachyon-${TACHYON_VERSION}"

# Directory where alternate Tachyon configuration templates are stored
#
# If you wish to tweak the configuration files used by Magpie, set
# TACHYON_CONF_FILES below, copy configuration templates from
# $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf/tachyon into TACHYON_CONF_FILES, and
# modify as you desire.  Magpie will still use configuration files in
# $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf/tachyon if any of the files it needs are not
# found in TACHYON_CONF_FILES.
#
# export TACHYON_CONF_FILES="${HOME}/myconf"

# TACHYON_STORE_TYPE
#
# Type of storage device Tachyon will use.  Currently supports MEM,
# SSD, or HDD.
#
export TACHYON_STORE_TYPE="SSD"

# TACHYON_STORE_PATHS
#
# Where Tachyon will store user data.
#
# If you want to specify multiple paths (such as multiple drives),
# make them comma separated (e.g. /dir1,/dir2,/dir3).
#
# If TACHYON_STORE_TYPE is "MEM", this must be an already created
# ramdisk.
#
export TACHYON_STORE_PATHS="LOCALDRIVEPREFIX/tachyon"

# TACHYON_STORE_QUOTA
#
# Amount of data Tachyon can store for the user.  Specified in gigs.
# Defaults to "100" if not specified.
#
# export TACHYON_STORE_QUOTA="100"

# TACHYON_JOURNAL_FOLDER
#
# By default, if not specified, Magpie will re-format the Tachyon file
# system on every re-start.  This is likely the situation most users
# will want, as Tachyon will be served predominantly as a caching
# store for data in an individual job.
#
# However, if you would like data preserved across jobs, the Tachyon
# journal must be maintained across jobs.  It must be stored in a
# permanent location in the below that is accessible on each job run,
# such as in an NFS or Lustre filesystem location.
#
# export TACHYON_JOURNAL_FOLDER="LUSTREDIRPREFIX/tachyon/journal/"

# TACHYON_WORKER_ON_MASTER
#
# Most big data projects do not have a "slave" or "worker" that also
# runs on the master node (such as Hadoop, Hbase, etc.).  Tachyon is
# an exception in which it often likes to have a worker running on the
# master node for convenience of running tests and such.
#
# It is not required to run a worker on the master, but it can be
# convenient.  Specify the below to "yes" to run a worker on the
# master.
# export TACHYON_WORKER_ON_MASTER="yes"

# Path to store data local to each cluster node, typically something
# in /tmp.  This will store local conf files and log files for your
# job.  If local scratch space is not available, consider using the
# MAGPIE_NO_LOCAL_DIR_DIR option.  See README for more details.
#
export TACHYON_LOCAL_DIR="LOCALDIRPREFIX/tachyon"

# Environment Extra
#
# Specify extra environment information that should be passed into
# Tachyon.  This file will simply be appended into the tachyon-env.sh.
#
# By default, a reasonable estimate for max user processes and open
# file descriptors will be calculated and put into tachyon-env.sh.
# However, it's always possible they may need to be set
# differently. Everyone's cluster/situation can be slightly different.
#
# See the example example-environment-extra for examples on
# what you can/should do with adding extra environment settings.
#
# export TACHYON_ENVIRONMENT_EXTRA_PATH="${HOME}/tachyon-my-environment"
