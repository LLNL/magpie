# Set how the filesystem should be setup

# "hdfs" - Normal straight up HDFS if you have local disk in your
#          cluster.  This option is primarily for benchmarking and
#          probably shouldn't be used in the general case.
#
#          Be careful running this in a cluster environment.  The next
#          time you execute your job, if a different set of nodes are
#          allocated to you, the HDFS data you wrote from a previous
#          job may not be there.  Specifying specific nodes to use in
#          your job submission (e.g. --nodelist in sbatch) may be a
#          way to alleviate this.
#
#          User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERLUSTRE_PATH below.
#
# "hdfsoverlustre" - HDFS over Lustre.  See README for description.
#
#                    User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERLUSTRE_PATH below. 
#
@MODE_HDFSOVERNETWORKFS@

# "rawnetworkfs" - Use Hadoop RawLocalFileSystem (i.e. file: scheme),
#           to use networked file system directly.  It could be a
#           Lustre mount or NFS mount.  Whatever you please.

# Option to use unique locations per job to store hdfs data
#
# If this is set to yes the nodes will append the 
# job id to the curernt HDFS, HDFSOVERLUSTRE and HDFSOVERNETWORKFS 
# path thus keeping the hdfs data isolated per job. This enables
# the same script to be executed multiple times (usually with
# different data) without the HDFSOVERXXX instances colliding with
# each other
#
# export HADOOP_PER_JOB_HDFS_PATH="yes"

# Path for HDFS when using local disk
#
# If you want to specify multiple paths (such as multiple drives),
# make them comma separated (e.g. /dir1,/dir2,/dir3).  The multiple
# paths will be used for local intermediate data and HDFS.  The first
# path will also store daemon data, such as namenode or jobtracker
# data.
#

# Lustre path to do Hadoop HDFS out of
#
# Note that different versions of Hadoop may not be compatible with
# your current HDFS data.  If you're going to switch around to
# different versions, perhaps set different paths for different data.
#
export HADOOP_HDFSOVERLUSTRE_PATH="LUSTREDIRPREFIX/hdfsoverlustre/"

# HDFS over Lustre ignore lock
#
# Remove in_use.lock files before launching HDFS
#
# On traditional Hadoop clusters, the in_use.lock file protects
# against a second HDFS daemon running on the same node.  The lock
# file can similarly protect against a second HDFS daemon running on
# another node of your cluster.
#
# However, sometimes the lock file can be an annoyance.  If several
# nodes in your cluster die and you simply restart the job on
# separate nodes, the lock file may still be present and prohibit new
# HDFS daemons to run.
#
# By default, if this option is not set, the lock file will be left in
# place and may cause HDFS daemons to not start.  If set to yes, the
# lock files will be removed before starting HDFS.

# If you have a local SSD, performance may be better to store
# intermediate data on it rather than Lustre or some other networked
# filesystem.  If the below environment variable is specified, local
# intermediate data will be stored in the specified directory.
# Otherwise it will go to an appropriate directory in Lustre/networked
# FS.
#
# Be wary, local SSDs stores may have less space than HDDs or
# networked file systems.  It can be easy to run out of space.

# If you want to specify multiple paths (such as multiple drives),
