# Zeppelin Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Zeppelin be setup
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to no.
#
# If ZEPPELIN_SETUP is enabled, this will inform Magpie to setup a
# configuration files and environment variables that will hopefully
# make it easier to run Zeppelin w/ HBase.  You could leave this disabled
# and setup/config Zeppelin as you need.
#
export ZEPPELIN_SETUP=no

# Zeppelin Version
#
export ZEPPELIN_VERSION="ZEPPELINVERSIONDEFAULT"

# Path to your Zeppelin build/binaries
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
# Ensure the build matches the hbase version this will run against.
#
export ZEPPELIN_HOME="ZEPPELINDIRPREFIX/zeppelin-${ZEPPELIN_VERSION}-bin-all"

# Directory where alternate Zeppelin configuration templates are stored
#
# If you wish to tweak the configuration files used by Magpie, set
# ZEPPELIN_CONF_FILES below, copy configuration templates from
# $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf/zeppelin into ZEPPELIN_CONF_FILES, and
# modify as you desire.  Magpie will still use configuration files in
# $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf/zeppelin if any of the files it needs are not
# found in ZEPPELIN_CONF_FILES.
#
# export ZEPPELIN_CONF_FILES="${HOME}/myconf"

# Path to store data local to each cluster node, typically something
# in /tmp.  This will store local conf files and log files for your
# job.  If local scratch space is not available, consider using the
# MAGPIE_NO_LOCAL_DIR_DIR option.  See README for more details.
#
export ZEPPELIN_LOCAL_DIR="LOCALDIRPREFIX/zeppelin"

# Set zeppelin job for MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE = zeppelin
#
# "checkzeppelinup" - Run a simple script to ensure Zeppelin is setup
#                     correctly and up.
#
export ZEPPELIN_JOB="checkzeppelinup"

# Path to the root scala dir
#
# This may need to be modified if the interpreter uses the wrong
# version of scala.
#
# The default does not add anything to your paths
#
# export ZEPPELIN_SCALA_PATH=${HOME}/scala-2.10.4

# Zeppelin Spark Submit Options
#
# Add additional options for starting Zeppelin with Spark.
#
# Note that when Zeppelin starts up it will use all cores and memory that
# Spark has available, this can be changed by adjusting Spark submit options.
# e.g. --total-executor-cores 20 --executor-memory 16G
#
# export ZEPPELIN_SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS=""

# Zeppelin Notebook Persisted Directory
#
# Specify a location for Zeppelin's notebook to persist.  If not
# specified, will point to a temporary directory and data will likely
# not persist between jobs.
#
# export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_DIR="LUSTREDIRPREFIX/zeppelin/notebook"

# Zeppelin Notebook Authorization
#
# Set username, password, and roles for required shiro login authorization.
# This setting must be in place prior to starting Zeppelin. The default 
# shiro.conf file is configured with two roles, admin and role1. 'admin' 
# allows configuration of the settings and 'role1' does not. Use ';' as a 
# delimiter for multiple users.
#export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_USERS="user1,password1,admin;user2,password2,role2"

# Zeppelin Notebook Authorization Security
#
# If this is set to 'true', you must provide the shiro encrypted password.
# An encrypted password can be created with the shiro-tools-hasher jar.
# See Note[1] in docs/README.zeppelin for more information
# export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPT_PASSWORD=true
