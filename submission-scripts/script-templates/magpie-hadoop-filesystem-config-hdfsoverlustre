# This is used with HADOOP_FILESYSTEM_MODE="hdfsoverlustre"

# your current HDFS data.  If you're going to switch around to
# different versions, perhaps set different paths for different data.

# HDFS over Lustre ignore lock

# This is used with HADOOP_FILESYSTEM_MODE="hdfsoverlustre"
#
# Cleanup in_use.lock files before launching HDFS
#
# On traditional Hadoop clusters, the in_use.lock file protects
# against a second HDFS daemon running on the same node.  The lock
# file can similarly protect against a second HDFS daemon running on
# another node of your cluster (which is not desired, as both
# namenodes could change namenode data at the same time).
#
# However, sometimes the lock file may be there due to a prior job
# that failed and locks were not cleaned up on teardown.  This may
# prohibit new HDFS daemons from running correctly.
#
# By default, if this option is not set, the lock file will be left in
# place and may cause HDFS daemons to not start.  If set to yes, the
# lock files will be removed before starting HDFS.
