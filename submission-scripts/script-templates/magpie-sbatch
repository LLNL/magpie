# Node count.  Node count should include one node for the
# head/management/master node.  For example, if you want 8 compute
# nodes to process data, specify 9 nodes below.
#
# If including Zookeeper, include expected Zookeeper nodes.  For
# example, if you want 8 Hadoop compute nodes and 3 Zookeeper nodes,
# specify 12 nodes (1 master, 8 Hadoop, 3 Zookeeper) 
#
# Also take into account additional nodes needed for other services,
# for example HDFS federation.

# Time to run the job
#
# Do not use --time, environment variable needed w/n magpie-run
#
# Note defaults of MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME & MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME, this
# timelimit should be a fair amount larger than them combined.

## SLURM Values
# Generally speaking, don't touch these, just need to configure slurm

#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --exclusive
#SBATCH --no-kill
