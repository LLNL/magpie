# Hadoop HDFS Federation

# HDFS Federation Namenode Count
#
# If HDFS federation is desired, specify the namenode count for it.
# For example, if you want two namenodes, specify 2 below.
#
# If not specified, only one namenode will be setup.
#
# export HDFS_FEDERATION_NAMENODE_COUNT=1

# HDFS Federation Mount points
#
# Specify the mount points to be used by your namenodes.
#
# Follow the pattern of
#
# HDFS_FEDERATION_NAMENODE_X_MOUNT_Y="path"
#
# Where X is the namenode number and Y is the mount number.
#
# For example, lets say you have two namenodes.  You want to mount
# /user and /home on namenode 1 and /data on namenode 2, you would set
# the following.
#
# HDFS_FEDERATION_NAMENODE_1_MOUNT_1="/user"
# HDFS_FEDERATION_NAMENODE_1_MOUNT_2="/home"
# HDFS_FEDERATION_NAMENODE_2_MOUNT_1="/data"
#
# The following is a template you can begin with.
#
# Atleast one mount for each namenode must be specified.
#
# All paths must be absolute paths beginning with a /
#
# Note that while it is not required, many Hadoop programs assume
# certains paths, such as /user, /tmp, and /data.  It would be wise to
# mount these with a namenode.
#
# export HDFS_FEDERATION_NAMENODE_1_MOUNT_1="/path1" 
#
# export HDFS_FEDERATION_NAMENODE_2_MOUNT_1="/path2" 
#
# export HDFS_FEDERATION_NAMENODE_3_MOUNT_1="/path3"
