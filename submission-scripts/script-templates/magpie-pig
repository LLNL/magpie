# Pig Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Pig be setup
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to no.
#
# Note that unlike Hadoop or Zookeeper, Pig does not need to be
# enabled/disabled to be run with Hadoop.  For example, no daemons are setup.
#
# If PIG_SETUP is enabled, this will inform Magpie to setup a
# configuration files and environment variables that will hopefully
# make it easier to run Pig w/ Hadoop.  You could leave this disabled
# and setup/config Pig as you need.
#
export PIG_SETUP=no

# Pig Version
#
export PIG_VERSION="PIGVERSIONDEFAULT"

# Path to your Pig build/binaries
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
# Ensure the build matches the Hadoop version this will run against.
#
export PIG_HOME="PIGDIRPREFIX/pig-${PIG_VERSION}"

# Directory where alternate Pig configuration templates are stored
#
# If you wish to tweak the configuration files used by Magpie, set
# PIG_CONF_FILES below, copy configuration templates from
# $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf/pig into PIG_CONF_FILES, and modify as you
# desire.  Magpie will still use configuration files in
# $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf/pig if any of the files it needs are not found
# in PIG_CONF_FILES.
#
# export PIG_CONF_FILES="${HOME}/myconf"

# Path to store data local to each cluster node, typically something
# in /tmp.  This will store local conf files and log files for your
# job.  If local scratch space is not available, consider using the
# MAGPIE_NO_LOCAL_DIR_DIR option.  See README for more details.
#
export PIG_LOCAL_DIR="LOCALDIRPREFIX/pig"

# Set how Pig should run
#
# "testpig" - Run a quick sanity test to see that pig is setup
#             correctly.  Testpig will do a simple ls of the root
#             directory of whatever filesytem you setup (e.g. hdfs,
#             lustre, etc.).
#
# "script" - execute a pig script indicated by PIG_SCRIPT_PATH.
#            Unlike "script" in MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE, this script is
#            executed via the 'pig' command.
#
export PIG_JOB="testpig"

# Specify script to execute for "script" mode in PIG_JOB.  This pig
# script will be fed into pig via "pig ${PIG_SCRIPT_OPTS} ${PIG_SCRIPT_PATH}"
#
# export PIG_SCRIPT_PATH="${HOME}/my-pig-script"

# Specify options to specify when calling pig.
#
# A particularly useful option is -l <logfile>, to indicate where you
# would like the pig log file to go.
#
# Another useful option is -F or -stop_on_failure
#
# export PIG_SCRIPT_OPTS="-l HOMEDIRPREFIX/mypig.log"

# Pig Classpath
#
# Set the classpath you desire for pig.  This is the CLASSPATH you
# likely want to set to add additional jars for your run.
#
# export PIG_CLASSPATH="HOMEDIRPREFIX/myjarfiles.jar"

# Pig Opts
#
# Extra Java runtime options
#
# export PIG_OPTS="-Djava.io.tmpdir=${PIG_LOCAL_JOB_DIR}/tmp"
