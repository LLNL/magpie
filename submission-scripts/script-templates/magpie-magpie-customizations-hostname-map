# Map Hostnames
#
# The MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD may be insufficient for setting the correct
# hostname to use in some situations.  For example, if the high speed
# interconnect is set to a hostname that is very different compared to
# the hostname configured in the scheduler/resource manager.
#
# Below commands can be set that will map
# hostnames/addresses/interfaces to the correct ones to use.  The
# commands you provide below should take a single argument as input,
# and return a single line of output with the host that should be
# used.
#
# The MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD_MAP command will be given the hostname as
# returned from the `hostname` command.  For example, if the scheduler
# uses the nodename "foobar", but you would like to use "foobar-ib",
# the script can simply return the hostname appended with "-ib".
#
# The MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_SCHEDULER_MAP command will be given the hostname
# returned from the scheduler.  For example, if your job has been
# given the nodes "foobar[0-4]", but you want to use the IPs attached
# to "foobar-ib[0-4]", your script can simply return the appropriate
# "foobar-ib" interface for each nodename passed in.
#
# The user is not required to set both of these commands, but the end
# result is that Magpie requires the output of:
#
# - the `hostname` command or MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD_MAP
# and
# - the scheduler nodes or MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_SCHEDULER_MAP
#
# to map to the same hostnames/addresses
#
# export MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD_MAP="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/hostname-map-scripts/my-script"
#
# export MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_SCHEDULER_MAP="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/hostname-map-scripts/my-script"
