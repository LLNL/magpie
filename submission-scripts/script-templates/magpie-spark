# Spark Core Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Spark be run
#
# Specify yes or no.  Defaults to no.
# 
export SPARK_SETUP=no

# Version
#
export SPARK_VERSION="1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.6"

# Path to your Spark build/binaries
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
# Ensure the build matches the Hadoop/HDFS version this will run against.
#
export SPARK_HOME="PROJECTDIRPREFIX/spark-${SPARK_VERSION}"

# Path to store data local to each cluster node, typically something
# in /tmp.  This will store local conf files and log files for your
# job.  If local scratch space is not available, consider using the
# MAGPIE_NO_LOCAL_DIR_DIR option.  See README for more details.
#
export SPARK_LOCAL_DIR="LOCALDIRPREFIX/spark"

# Directory where Spark configuration templates are stored
#
# If not specified, assumed to be $MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME/conf
#
# export SPARK_CONF_FILES="${HOME}/myconf"

# Worker Cores per Node
#
# If not specified, a reasonable estimate will be calculated based on
# number of CPUs on the system.
#
# If also running Hbase or Hadoop MapReduce, be aware of the number of
# tasks and the amount of memory that may be needed by other software.
#
# export SPARK_WORKER_CORES_PER_NODE=8

# Worker Memory
#
# Specified in M.  If not specified, a reasonable estimate will be
# calculated based on total memory available and number of CPUs on the
# system.
#
# If also running Hbase or Hadoop MapReduce, be aware of the number of
# tasks and the amount of memory that may be needed by other software.
#
# export SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY_PER_NODE=16000

# Worker Directory
#
# Directory to run applications in, which will include both logs and
# scratch space for local jars.  If not specified, defaults to
# SPARK_LOCAL_DIR/work.
#
# Generally speaking, this is best if this is a tmp directory such as
# in /tmp
#
# export SPARK_WORKER_DIRECTORY=LOCALDIRPREFIX/spark/work

# SPARK_JOB_MEMORY
#
# Memory for spark jobs.  Defaults to being set equal to
# SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY_PER_NODE, but users may wish to lower it if
# multiple Spark jobs will be submitted at the same time.
#
# In Spark parlance, this will set both the executor and driver memory
# for Spark.
#
# export SPARK_JOB_MEMORY="2048"

# SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY
#
# Beginning in Spark 1.0, driver memory could be configured separately
# from executor memory.  If SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY is set below, driver
# memory will be configured differently than the executor memory
# indicated above with SPARK_JOB_MEMORY.
#
# If running Spark < 1.0, this option does nothing. 
#
# export SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY="2048"

# Daemon Heap Max
#
# Heap maximum for Spark daemons, specified in megs.
#
# If not specified, defaults to 1000
#
# May need to be increased if you are scaling large, get OutofMemory
# errors, or perhaps have a lot of cores on a node.
#
# export SPARK_DAEMON_HEAP_MAX=2000

# Environment Extra
#
# Specify extra environment information that should be passed into
# Spark.  This file will simply be appended into the spark-env.sh.
#
# By default, a reasonable estimate for max user processes and open
# file descriptors will be calculated and put into spark-env.sh.
# However, it's always possible they may need to be set
# differently. Everyone's cluster/situation can be slightly different.
#
# See the example example-environment-extra for examples on
# what you can/should do with adding extra environment settings.
#
# export SPARK_ENVIRONMENT_EXTRA_PATH="${HOME}/spark-my-environment"

# Spark Job/Run Configurations
############################################################################

# Set how Spark should run
#
# "sparkpi" - run sparkpi example. Useful for making sure things are
#             setup the way you like.
#
#             There are additional configuration options for this
#             example listed below.
#
# "sparkwordcount" - run wordcount example.  Useful for making sure
#                    things are setup the way you like.
#
#                    See below for additional required configuration
#                    for this example.
#
# "script" - execute a script that lists all of your Spark jobs.  Be
#            sure to set SPARK_SCRIPT_PATH to your script.
#
# "interactive" - manually interact to submit jobs, peruse Spark, etc.
#                 In this mode you'll login to the cluster node that
#                 is your 'master' node and interact with Spark
#                 directly (e.g. bin/spark-shell ...)
#
# "setuponly" - Like 'interactive' but only setup conf files. useful
#               if user wants to setup daemons themselves, etc.
#
export SPARK_MODE="sparkpi"

# SPARK_DEFAULT_PARALLELISM
#
# Default number of tasks to use across the cluster for distributed
# shuffle operations (groupByKey, reduceByKey, etc) when not set by
# user. If not specified, defaults to # compute nodes (i.e. 1 per node)
#
# This is something you (the user) almost definitely want to set.
#
# export SPARK_DEFAULT_PARALLELISM=8

# SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION
#
# Configure fraction of Java heap to use for Spark's memory cache.
# This should not be larger than the "old" generation of objects in
# the JVM.  This can highly affect performance due to interruption due
# to JVM garbage collection.  If a large amount of time is spent in
# garbage collection, consider shrinking this value, such as to 0.5 or
# 0.4.
#
# Defaults to 0.6
#
# export SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.6

# SPARK_SHUFFLE_MEMORY_FRACTION
#
# Fraction of Java heap to use for aggregation and cogroups during
# shuffles.  At any given time, the collective size of all in-memory
# maps used for shuffles is bounded by this limit, beyond which the
# contents will begin to spill to disk.  If spills are often, consider
# increasing this value at the expense of storage memory fraction
# (SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION above).
#
# Defaults to 0.3
#
# export SPARK_SHUFFLE_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.3

# SPARK_DEPLOY_SPREADOUT
#
# Per Spark documentation, "Whether the standalone cluster manager
# should spread applications out across nodes or try to consolidate
# them onto as few nodes as possible. Spreading out is usually better
# for data locality in HDFS, but consolidating is more efficient for
# compute-intensive workloads."
#
# If you are hard coding parallelism in certain parts of your
# application because those individual actions do not scale well, it
# may be beneficial to disable this.
#
# Defaults to true
#
# export SPARK_DEPLOY_SPREADOUT=true

# SPARK_JOB_CLASSPATH
#
# May be necessary to set to get certain code/scripts to work.
#
# e.g. to run a Spark example, you may need to set
#
# export SPARK_JOB_CLASSPATH="examples/target/spark-examples-assembly-0.9.1.jar"
#
# Note that this is primarily for Spark 0.9.1 and earlier versions.
# You likely want to use the --driver-class-path option in
# spark-submit now.
#
# export SPARK_JOB_CLASSPATH=""

# SPARK_JOB_LIBRARY_PATH
#
# May be necessary to set to get certain code/scripts to work.
#
# Note that this is primarily for Spark 0.9.1 and earlier versions.
# You likely want to use the --driver-library-path option in
# spark-submit now.
#
# export SPARK_JOB_LIBRARY_PATH=""

# SPARK_JOB_JAVA_OPTS  
#
# May be necessary to set options to set Spark options
#
# e.g. -Dspark.default.parallelism=16
#
# Magpie will set several options on its own, however, these options
# will be appended last, ensuring they override anything that Magpie
# will set by default.
#
# Note that many of the options that were set in SPARK_JAVA_OPTS in
# Spark 0.9.1 and earlier have been deprecated.  You likely want to
# use the --driver-java-options option in spark-submit now.
#
# export SPARK_JOB_JAVA_OPTS=""

# SPARK_LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR
#
# By default, if Hadoop is setup with a file system, the Spark local
# scratch directory, where scratch data is placed, will automatically
# be calculated and configured.  If Hadoop is not setup, the following
# must be specified.
#
# If you have local SSDs stored on the nodes of your system, it may be
# in your interest to set this to a local drive.  It can improve
# performance of both shuffling and disk based RDD persistence.
#
# export SPARK_LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR="LUSTREDIRPREFIX/sparkscratch/"

# Spark SparkPi Configuration
############################################################################

# SparkPi Slices
#
# Number of "slices" to parallelize in Pi estimation.  Generally
# speaking, more should lead to more accurate estimates.
#
# If not specified, equals number of nodes.
# 
# export SPARK_SPARKPI_SLICES=4

############################################################################
# Spark SparkWordCount Configuration
############################################################################

# SparkWordCount File
#
# Specify the file to do the word count on.  Specify the scheme, such
# as hdfs:// or file://, appropriately.
# 
# export SPARK_SPARKWORDCOUNT_FILE="/mywordcountfile"

# SparkWordCount Copy In File
#
# In some cases, a file must be copied in before it can be used.  Most
# notably, this can be the case if the file is not yet in HDFS.
#
# If specified below, the file will be copied to the location
# specified by SPARK_SPARKWORDCOUNT_FILE before the word count is
# executed.  
#
# Specify the scheme appropriately.  At this moment, the schemes of
# file:// and hdfs:// are recognized for this option.
#
# Note that this is not required.  The file could be copied in any
# number of other ways, such as through a previous job or through a
# script specified via MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN.
#
# export SPARK_SPARKWORDCOUNT_COPY_IN_FILE="/mywordcountfile"

############################################################################
# Spark Script Configurations
############################################################################

# Specify script to execute for "script" mode
#
# See examples/spark-example-job-script for example of what to put in
# the script.
