# Hadoop Job/Run Configurations
############################################################################

# Set how Hadoop should run
#
# "terasort" - run terasort.  Useful for making sure things are setup
#              the way you like.
#
#              There are additional configuration options for this
#              listed below.
#
# "script" - execute a script that lists all of your Hadoop jobs.  Be
#            sure to set HADOOP_SCRIPT_PATH to your script.
#
# "upgradehdfs" - upgrade your version of HDFS.  Most notably this is
#                 used when you are switching to a newer Hadoop
#                 version and the HDFS version would be inconsistent
#                 without upgrading.  Only works with HDFS versions >=
#                 2.2.0.
#
#	          Please set your job time to be quite large when
#		  performing this upgrade.  If your job times out and
#		  this process does not complete fully, it can leave
#		  HDFS in a bad state.
#
#		  Beware, once you upgrade it'll be difficult to rollback.
#
# "decommissionhdfsnodes" - decrease your HDFS over Lustre or HDFS
#                           over NetworkFS node size just as if you
#                           were on a cluster with local disk.  Launch
#                           your job with the current present node
#                           size and set
#                           HADOOP_DECOMMISSION_HDFS_NODE_SIZE to the
#                           smaller node size to decommission into.
#                           Only works on Hadoop versions >= 2.3.0.
#
#		            Please set your job time to be quite large
#		            when performing this update.  If your job
#		            times out and this process does not
#		            complete fully, it can leave HDFS in a bad
#		            state.
