# an extremely small amount of it) for small config files, log files,
# and other temporary scratch space, set the following to yes and see
# the README for patching requirements to projects.

# This option applies to all LOCAL_DIR environment variables, such as
# MAGPIE_LOCAL_DIR, HADOOP_LOCAL_DIR, HBASE_LOCAL_DIR, etc.

# Defaults to no.
