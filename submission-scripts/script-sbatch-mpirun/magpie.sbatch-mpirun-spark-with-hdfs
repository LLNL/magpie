# Magpie job type
#
# "spark" - Run a job according to the settings of SPARK_JOB.
#
# "testall" - Run a job that runs all basic sanity tests for all
#             software that is configured to be setup.  This is a good
#             way to sanity check that everything has been setup
#             correctly and the way you like.
#
#             For Spark, testall will run sparkpi
#
# "script" - Run arbitraty script, as specified by MAGPIE_JOB_SCRIPT.
#            You can find example job scripts in examples/.
#
# "interactive" - manually interact with job run to submit jobs,
#                 peruse data (e.g. HDFS), move data, etc.  See job
#                 output for instructions to access your job
#                 allocation.
#
# "setuponly" - do not launch any daemons or services, only setup
#               configuration files.  Useful for debugging or
#               development.
#
export MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE="spark"

# Specify script and arguments to execute for "script" mode in
# MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE
#
# export MAGPIE_JOB_SCRIPT="${HOME}/my-job-script"

# Specify script startup / shutdown time window
#
# Specifies the amount of time to give startup / shutdown activities a
# chance to succeed before Magpie will give up (or in the case of
# shutdown, when the resource manager/scheduler may kill the running
# job).  Defaults to 30 minutes for startup, 30 minutes for shutdown.
#
# The startup time in particular may need to be increased if you have
# a large amount of data.  As an example, HDFS may need to spend a
# significant amount of time determine all of the blocks in HDFS
# before leaving safemode.
#
# The stop time in particular may need to be increased if you have a
# large amount of cleanup to be done.  HDFS will save its NameSpace
# before shutting down.  Hbase will do a compaction before shutting
# down.
#
# The startup & shutdown window must together be smaller than the
# timelimit specified for the job.
#
# MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME and MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME at minimum must be 5
# minutes.  If MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN is specified below,
# MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME must be at minimum 10 minutes.
#
# export MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME=30
# export MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME=30

# Magpie One Time Run
#
# Normally, Magpie assumes that when a user runs a job, data created
# and stored within that job will be desired to be accessed again.  For
# example, data created and stored within HDFS will be accessed again.
#
# Under a number of scenarios, this may not be desired.  For example
# during testing.
#
# To improve useability and performance, setting MAGPIE_ONE_TIME_RUN
# below to yes will have two effects on the Magpie job.
#
# 1) A number of data paths (such as for HDFS) will be put into unique
#    paths for this job.  Therefore, no other job should be able to
#    access the data again.  This is particularly useful if you wish
#    to run performance tests with this job script over and over
#    again.
#
#    Magpie will not remove data that was written, so be sure to clean up
#    your directories later.
#
# 2) In order to improve job throughout, Magpie will take shortcuts by
#    not properly tearing down the job.  As data corruption should not be
#    a concern on job teardown, the job can complete more quickly.
#
# export MAGPIE_ONE_TIME_RUN=yes

# Convenience Scripts
#
# Specify script to be executed to before / after your job.  It is run
# on all nodes.
#
# Typically the pre-job script is used to set something up or get
# debugging info.  It can also be used to determine if system
# conditions meet the expectations of your job.  The primary job
# running script (magpie-run) will not be executed if the
# MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN exits with a non-zero exit code.
#
# The post-job script is typically used for cleaning up something or
# gathering info (such as logs) for post-debugging/analysis.  If it is
# set, MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME above must be > 5.
#
# See example magpie-example-pre-job-script and
# magpie-example-post-job-script for ideas of what you can do w/ these
# scripts
#
# Multiple scripts can be specified separated by comma.  Arguments can
# be passed to scripts as well.
#
# A number of convenient scripts are available in the
# ${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts directory.
#
# export MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/pre-job-run-scripts/my-pre-job-script"
# export MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/post-job-run-scripts/my-post-job-script"
#
# Similar to the MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN and MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN, scripts can be
# run after the stack is setup but prior to the script or interactive mode
# begins. This enables frontends and other processes that depend on the stack
# to be started up and torn down. In similar fashion the cleanup will be done
# immediately after the script or interactive mode exits before the stack is
# shutdown.
#
# export MAGPIE_PRE_EXECUTE_RUN="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/pre-job-run-scripts/my-pre-job-script"
# export MAGPIE_POST_EXECUTE_RUN="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/post-job-run-scripts/my-post-job-script"

# Environment Variable Script
#
# When working with Magpie interactively by logging into the master
# node of your job allocation, many environment variables may need to
# be set.  For example, environment variables for config file
# directories (e.g. HADOOP_CONF_DIR, HBASE_CONF_DIR, etc.) and home
# directories (e.g. HADOOP_HOME, HBASE_HOME, etc.) and more general
# environment variables (e.g. JAVA_HOME) may need to be set before you
# begin interacting with your big data setup.
#
# The standard job output from Magpie provides instructions on all the
# environment variables typically needed to interact with your job.
# However, this can be tedious if done by hand.
#
# If the environment variable specified below is set, Magpie will
# create the file and put into it every environment variable that
# would be useful when running your job interactively.  That way, it
# can be sourced easily if you will be running your job interactively.
# It can also be loaded or used by other job scripts.
#
# export MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT="${HOME}/my-job-env"

# Environment Variable Shell Type
#
# Magpie outputs environment variables in help output and
# MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT based on your SHELL environment
# variable.
#
# If you would like to output in a different shell type (perhaps you
# have programmed scripts in a different shell), specify that shell
# here.
#
# export MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT_SHELL="/bin/bash"

# Hostname config
#
# Magpie internally assumes that the nodenames provided by the
# scheduler/resource manager are the addresses that should be used for
# configuration AND they are identical to the output of the `hostname`
# command, which is used by Magpie to determine what nodes individual
# services should run on.
#
# If this is not true in your environment, you can provide an alternate
# hostname command below to correct this.  Very often, users may need to
# set:
#
# MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD="hostname -s" // use short hostname
# or
# MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD="hostname -f" // use FQDN
#
# If you have a more complex situation, see README.hostname for more
# advanced options.
#
# export MAGPIE_HOSTNAME_CMD="hostname"

# Remote Shell
#
# Magpie requires a passwordless remote shell command to launch
# necessary daemons across your job allocation.  Magpie defaults to
# ssh, but it may be an alternate command in some environments.  An
# alternate ssh-equivalent remote command can be specified by setting
# MAGPIE_REMOTE_CMD below.
#
# If using ssh, Magpie requires keys to be setup ahead of time so it
# can be executed without passwords.
#
# Specify options to the remote shell command if necessary.
#
# export MAGPIE_REMOTE_CMD="ssh"
# export MAGPIE_REMOTE_CMD_OPTS=""

# Hadoop Job/Run Configurations
############################################################################

# Set hadoop job for MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE = hadoop
#
# "terasort" - run terasort.  Useful for making sure things are setup
#              the way you like.
#
#              There are additional configuration options for this
#              listed below.
#
# "upgradehdfs" - upgrade your version of HDFS.  Most notably this is
#                 used when you are switching to a newer Hadoop
#                 version and the HDFS version would be inconsistent
#                 without upgrading.  Only works with HDFS versions >=
#                 2.2.0.
#
#	          Please set your job time to be quite large when
#		  performing this upgrade.  If your job times out and
#		  this process does not complete fully, it can leave
#		  HDFS in a bad state.
#
#		  Beware, once you upgrade it'll be difficult to rollback.
#
# "decommissionhdfsnodes" - decrease your HDFS over Lustre or HDFS
#                           over NetworkFS node size just as if you
#                           were on a cluster with local disk.  Launch

# Set how the filesystem should be setup
#
# "hdfs" - Normal straight up HDFS if you have local disk in your

#          caching, but probably shouldn't be used in the general case.
#
#          Be careful running this in a cluster environment.  The next
#          time you execute your job, if a different set of nodes are
#          allocated to you, the HDFS data you wrote from a previous
#          job may not be there.  Specifying specific nodes to use in
#          your job submission (e.g. --nodelist in sbatch) may be a
#          way to alleviate this.
#
#          User must set HADOOP_HDFS_PATH below.
#
# "hdfsoverlustre" - HDFS over Lustre.  See README for description.
#
#                    User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERLUSTRE_PATH below.
#
# "hdfsovernetworkfs" - HDFS over Network FS.  Identical to HDFS over
#                       Lustre, but filesystem agnostic.
#
#                       User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERNETWORKFS_PATH below.
#
# "rawnetworkfs" - Use Hadoop RawLocalFileSystem (i.e. file: scheme),
#           to use networked file system directly.  It could be a
#           Lustre mount or NFS mount.  Whatever you please.

#
# - The Spark standalone scheduler will not be launched
# - The default Spark master will be set to 'yarn-client' (Spark 1.X)
#   or 'yarn' (Spark [2-3].X) in all appropriate locations
#   (e.g. spark-defaults.conf)
# - All situations that would otherwise use the standalone scheduler

# SPARK_DEFAULT_PARALLELISM
#
# Default number of tasks to use across the cluster for distributed
# shuffle operations (groupByKey, reduceByKey, etc) when not set by
# user.
#
# For Spark versions < 1.3.0.  Defaults to number compute nodes
# (i.e. 1 per node) This is something you (the user) almost definitely
# want to set as this is non-optimal for most jobs.
#
# For Spark versions >= 1.3.0, will not be set by Magpie if the below
# is commented out.  Internally, Spark defaults this to the largest
# number of partitions in a parent RDD.  Or for operations without a
# parent, defaults to nodes X cores.
#
# export SPARK_DEFAULT_PARALLELISM=8

# SPARK_MEMORY_FRACTION
#
# Fraction of heap space used for execution and storage. The lower
# this is, the more frequently spills and cached data eviction occur.
#
# This configuration only works for Spark versions >= 1.6.0.  See
# SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION and SPARK_SHUFFLE_MEMORY_FRACTION for
# older versions.
#
# Defaults to 0.6
#
# export SPARK_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.6

# SPARK_MEMORY_STORAGE_FRACTION
#
# Amount of storage memory immune to eviction, expressed as a fraction
# of the size of the region set aside by SPARK_MEMORY_FRACTION.  The
# higher this is, the less working memory may be available to
# executiona nd tasks may spill to disk more often.
#
# This configuration only works for Spark versions >= 1.6.0.  See
# SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION and SPARK_SHUFFLE_MEMORY_FRACTION for
# older versions.
#
# Defaults to 0.5
#
# export SPARK_MEMORY_STORAGE_FRACTION=0.5

# SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION
#
# Configure fraction of Java heap to use for Spark's memory cache.
# This should not be larger than the "old" generation of objects in
# the JVM.  This can highly affect performance due to interruption due
# to JVM garbage collection.  If a large amount of time is spent in
# garbage collection, consider shrinking this value, such as to 0.5 or
# 0.4.
#
# This configuration only works for Spark versions < 1.6.0.  Starting

# Defaults to 0.6
#
# export SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.6

# SPARK_SHUFFLE_MEMORY_FRACTION
#
# Fraction of Java heap to use for aggregation and cogroups during
# shuffles.  At any given time, the collective size of all in-memory
# maps used for shuffles is bounded by this limit, beyond which the
# contents will begin to spill to disk.  If spills are often, consider
# increasing this value at the expense of storage memory fraction
# (SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION above).
#
# This configuration only works for Spark versions < 1.6.0.  Starting
# with 1.6.0, see SPARK_MEMORY_FRACTION and

# Defaults to 0.2
#
# export SPARK_SHUFFLE_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.2

# SPARK_RDD_COMPRESS
#
# Should RDD's be compressed by default?  Defaults to true.  In HPC
# environments with parallel file systems or local storage, the cost
# of compressing / decompressing RDDs is likely a be a net win over
# writing data to a parallel file system or using up the limited
# amount of local storage space available.  However, for some users
# this cost may not be worthwhile and should be disabled.
#
# Note that only serialized RDDs are compressed, such as with storage
# level MEMORY_ONLY_SER or MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER.  All python RDDs are
# serialized by default.
#
# Defaults to true.

# export SPARK_IO_COMPRESSION_CODEC=lz4

# SPARK_DEPLOY_SPREADOUT
#
# Per Spark documentation, "Whether the standalone cluster manager
# should spread applications out across nodes or try to consolidate
# them onto as few nodes as possible. Spreading out is usually better
# for data locality in HDFS, but consolidating is more efficient for
# compute-intensive workloads."
#
# If you are hard coding parallelism in certain parts of your
# application because those individual actions do not scale well, it
# may be beneficial to disable this.
#
# Defaults to true
#
# export SPARK_DEPLOY_SPREADOUT=true

# SPARK_LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR
#
# By default, if Hadoop is setup with a file system, the Spark local
# scratch directory, where scratch data is placed, will automatically
# be calculated and configured.  If Hadoop is not setup, the following
# must be specified.
#
# If you have local SSDs or NVRAM stored on the nodes of your system,
# it may be in your interest to set this to a local drive.  It can
# improve performance of both shuffling and disk based RDD
# persistence.  If you want to specify multiple paths (such as
# multiple drives), make them comma separated
# (e.g. /dir1,/dir2,/dir3).

# issues, try increasing this value.  On large HPC systems, timeouts
# may occur more often, such as on loaded parallel file systems or
# busy networks.
#
# As of this version, this will configure:
#
# spark.network.timeout
# spark.files.fetchTimeout
# spark.rpc.askTimeout
# spark.rpc.lookupTimeout
# spark.core.connection.ack.wait.timeout
# spark.shuffle.registration.timeout

# SPARK_YARN_STAGING_DIR
#
# By default, Spark w/ Yarn will use your home directory for staging
# files for a job.  This home directory must be accessible by all
# nodes.
#
# This may pose a problem if you are not using HDFS and your home
# directory is not NFS or network mounted.  Set this value to a
