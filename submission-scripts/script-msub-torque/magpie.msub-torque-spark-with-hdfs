# Magpie job type
#
# "hadoop" - Run a job according to the settings of HADOOP_MODE.
#
# "hbase" - Run a job according to the settings of HBASE_MODE.
#
# "pig" - Run a job according to the settings of PIG_MODE.
#
# "spark" - Run a job according to the settings of SPARK_MODE.
#
# "storm" - Run a job according to the settings of STORM_MODE.
#
# "tachyon" - Run a job according ot the settings of TACHYON_MODE. 
#
# "zookeeper" - Run a job according to the settings of ZOOKEEPER_MODE.
#
# "testall" - Run a job that runs all basic sanity tests for all
#             software that is configured to be setup.  This is a good
#             way to sanity check that everything has been setup
#             correctly and the way you like.
#
#             For Hadoop, testall will run terasort
#             For Hbase, testall will run performanceeval
#             For Pig, testall will run testpig
#             For Spark, testall will run sparkpi
#             For Storm, testall will run stormwordcount
#             For tachyon, testall will run testtachyon
#             For Zookeeper, testall will run zookeeperruok
#
# "script" - Run an arbitraty script, as specified by
#            MAGPIE_SCRIPT_PATH.  This functionally is very similar to
#            setting "script" in HADOOP_MODE or HBASE_MODE or
#            SPARK_MODE or STORM_MODE.
#
#            It is primarily used if you want to launch without
#            Hadoop/Hbase/Spark/Storm (such as Zookeeper only) and are
#            experimenting with things..
#
# "interactive" - manually interact with job run.  This functionally
#                 is very similar to setting "interactive" in
#                 HADOOP_MODE, HBASE_MODE, SPARK_MODE, STORM_MODE, or
#                 PIG_MODE.  It is primarily used if you want to
#                 launch without Hadoop/Hbase/Spark/Storm (such as

# Specify script to execute for "script" mode in MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE
#
# export MAGPIE_SCRIPT_PATH="${HOME}/my-job-script"

# Specify script startup / shutdown time window
#
# Specifies the amount of time to give startup / shutdown activities a
# chance to succeed before Magpie will give up (or in the case of
# shutdown, when the resource manager/scheduler may kill the running
# job).  Defaults to 30 minutes for startup, 30 minutes for shutdown.
#
# The startup time in particular may need to be increased if you have
# a large amount of data.  As an example, HDFS may need to spend a
# significant amount of time determine all of the blocks in HDFS
# before leaving safemode.
#
# The stop time in particular may need to be increased if you have a
# large amount of cleanup to be done.  HDFS will save its NameSpace
# before shutting down.  Hbase will do a compaction before shutting
# down.
#
# The startup & shutdown window must together be smaller than the
# SBATCH_TIMELIMIT specified above.
#
# MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME and MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME at minimum must be 5
# minutes.  If MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN is specified below,
# MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME must be at minimum 10 minutes.
#
# export MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME=30
# export MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME=30

# Convenience Scripts
#
# Specify script to be executed to before / after your job.  It is run
# on all nodes.
#
# Typically the pre-job script is used to set something up or get
# debugging info.  It can also be used to determine if system
# conditions meet the expectations of your job.  The primary job
# running script (magpie-run) will not be executed if the
# MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN exits with a non-zero exit code.
#
# The post-job script is typically used for cleaning up something or
# gathering info (such as logs) for post-debugging/analysis.  If it is
# set, MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME above must be > 5.
# 
# See example magpie-example-pre-job-script and
# magpie-example-post-job-script for ideas of what you can do w/ these
# scripts
#
# A number of convenient scripts are available in the scripts
# directory.
#
# export MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN="${HOME}/magpie-my-pre-job-script"
# export MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN="${HOME}/magpie-my-post-job-script"

# Environment Variable Script
#
# When working with Magpie interactively by logging into the master
# node of your job allocation, many environment variables may need to
# be set.  For example, environment variables for config file
# directories (e.g. HADOOP_CONF_DIR, HBASE_CONF_DIR, etc.) and home
# directories (e.g. HADOOP_HOME, HBASE_HOME, etc.) and more general
# environment variables (e.g. JAVA_HOME) may need to be set before you
# begin interacting with your big data setup.
#
# The standard job output from Magpie provides instructions on all the
# environment variables typically needed to interact with your job.
# However, this can be tedious if done by hand.
#
# If the environment variable specified below is set, Magpie will
# create the file and put into it every environment variable that
# would be useful when running your job interactively.  That way, it
# can be sourced easily if you will be running your job interactively.
# It can also be loaded or used by other job scripts.
#
# export MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT="${HOME}/my-job-env"

# Environment Variable Shell Type
#
# Magpie outputs environment variables in help output and
# MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT based on your SHELL environment
# variable.
#
# If you would like to output in a different shell type (perhaps you
# have programmed scripts in a different shell), specify that shell
# here.
#
# export MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT_SHELL="/bin/bash"

# Remote Shell 
#
# Magpie requires a passwordless remote shell command to launch
# necessary daemons across your job allocation.  Magpie defaults to
# ssh, but it may be an alternate command in some environments.  An
# alternate ssh-equivalent remote command can be specified by setting
# MAGPIE_REMOTE_CMD below.
#
# If using ssh, Magpie requires keys to be setup ahead of time so it
# can be executed without passwords.
#
# Specify options to the remote shell command if necessary.
#
# export MAGPIE_REMOTE_CMD="ssh"

############################################################################
# Hadoop Job/Run Configurations
############################################################################

# Set how Hadoop should run
#
# "terasort" - run terasort.  Useful for making sure things are setup
#              the way you like.
#
#              There are additional configuration options for this
#              example listed below.
#
# "script" - execute a script that lists all of your Hadoop jobs.  Be
#            sure to set HADOOP_SCRIPT_PATH to your script.
#
# "interactive" - manually interact to submit jobs, peruse HDFS, etc.
#                 also useful for moving data in/out of HDFS.  In this
#                 mode you'll login to the cluster node that is your
#                 'master' node and interact with Hadoop directly
#                 (e.g. bin/hadoop ...)
#
# "upgradehdfs" - upgrade your version of HDFS.  Most notably this is
#                 used when you are switching to a newer Hadoop
#                 version and the HDFS version would be inconsistent
#                 without upgrading.  Only works with HDFS versions >=
#                 2.2.0.
#
#		  Beware, once you upgrade it'll be difficult to rollback.
#
# "launch" - Launch Hadoop but do nothing, usually set to this because
#            another project (e.g. Hbase, Pig) will run something that
#            uses Hadoop MapReduce.
#
# "setuponly" - Like 'interactive' but only setup conf files. useful
#               if user wants to setup daemons themselves, etc.
#
# "hdfsonly" - For use if HADOOP_SETUP_TYPE is set to HDFS1 or HDFS2. 
#
export HADOOP_MODE="hdfsonly"

############################################################################
# Hadoop Filesystem Mode Configurations
############################################################################

# Set how the filesystem should be setup
#
# "hdfs" - Normal straight up HDFS if you have local disk in your
#          cluster.  This option is primarily for benchmarking and
#          probably shouldn't be used in the general case.
#
#          Be careful running this in a cluster environment.  The next
#          time you execute your job, if a different set of nodes are
#          allocated to you, the HDFS data you wrote from a previous
#          job may not be there.  Specifying specific nodes to use in
#          your job submission (e.g. --nodelist in sbatch) may be a
#          way to alleviate this.
#
#          User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERLUSTRE_PATH below.
#
# "hdfsoverlustre" - HDFS over Lustre.  See README for description.
#
#                    User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERLUSTRE_PATH below. 
#
# "hdfsovernetworkfs" - HDFS over Network FS.  Identical to HDFS over
#                       Lustre, but filesystem agnostic.
#
#                       User must set HADOOP_HDFSOVERNETWORKFS_PATH below.
#
# "rawnetworkfs" - Use Hadoop RawLocalFileSystem (i.e. file: scheme),
#           to use networked file system directly.  It could be a
#           Lustre mount or NFS mount.  Whatever you please.

#                 is your 'master' node and interact with Spark
#                 directly (e.g. bin/spark-shell ...)
#
# "setuponly" - Like 'interactive' but only setup conf files. useful
#               if user wants to setup daemons themselves, etc.
#
export SPARK_MODE="sparkpi"

# SPARK_DEFAULT_PARALLELISM
#
# Default number of tasks to use across the cluster for distributed
# shuffle operations (groupByKey, reduceByKey, etc) when not set by
# user. If not specified, defaults to # compute nodes (i.e. 1 per node)
#
# This is something you (the user) almost definitely want to set.
#
# export SPARK_DEFAULT_PARALLELISM=8

# SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION
#
# Configure fraction of Java heap to use for Spark's memory cache.
# This should not be larger than the "old" generation of objects in
# the JVM.  This can highly affect performance due to interruption due
# to JVM garbage collection.  If a large amount of time is spent in
# garbage collection, consider shrinking this value, such as to 0.5 or
# 0.4.
#
# Defaults to 0.6
#
# export SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.6

# SPARK_SHUFFLE_MEMORY_FRACTION
#
# Fraction of Java heap to use for aggregation and cogroups during
# shuffles.  At any given time, the collective size of all in-memory
# maps used for shuffles is bounded by this limit, beyond which the
# contents will begin to spill to disk.  If spills are often, consider
# increasing this value at the expense of storage memory fraction
# (SPARK_STORAGE_MEMORY_FRACTION above).
#
# Defaults to 0.3
#
# export SPARK_SHUFFLE_MEMORY_FRACTION=0.3

# SPARK_DEPLOY_SPREADOUT
#
# Per Spark documentation, "Whether the standalone cluster manager
# should spread applications out across nodes or try to consolidate
# them onto as few nodes as possible. Spreading out is usually better
# for data locality in HDFS, but consolidating is more efficient for
# compute-intensive workloads."
#
# If you are hard coding parallelism in certain parts of your
# application because those individual actions do not scale well, it
# may be beneficial to disable this.
#
# Defaults to true
#
# export SPARK_DEPLOY_SPREADOUT=true

# SPARK_JOB_CLASSPATH
#
# May be necessary to set to get certain code/scripts to work.
#
# e.g. to run a Spark example, you may need to set
#
# export SPARK_JOB_CLASSPATH="examples/target/spark-examples-assembly-0.9.1.jar"
#
# Note that this is primarily for Spark 0.9.1 and earlier versions.
# You likely want to use the --driver-class-path option in
# spark-submit now.
#
# export SPARK_JOB_CLASSPATH=""

# SPARK_JOB_LIBRARY_PATH
#
# May be necessary to set to get certain code/scripts to work.
#
# Note that this is primarily for Spark 0.9.1 and earlier versions.
# You likely want to use the --driver-library-path option in
# spark-submit now.
#
# export SPARK_JOB_LIBRARY_PATH=""

# SPARK_JOB_JAVA_OPTS  
#
# May be necessary to set options to set Spark options
#
# e.g. -Dspark.default.parallelism=16
#
# Magpie will set several options on its own, however, these options
# will be appended last, ensuring they override anything that Magpie
# will set by default.
#
# Note that many of the options that were set in SPARK_JAVA_OPTS in
# Spark 0.9.1 and earlier have been deprecated.  You likely want to
# use the --driver-java-options option in spark-submit now.
#
# export SPARK_JOB_JAVA_OPTS=""

# SPARK_LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR
#
# By default, if Hadoop is setup with a file system, the Spark local
# scratch directory, where scratch data is placed, will automatically
# be calculated and configured.  If Hadoop is not setup, the following
# must be specified.
#
# If you have local SSDs stored on the nodes of your system, it may be
# in your interest to set this to a local drive.  It can improve
# performance of both shuffling and disk based RDD persistence.
#
# export SPARK_LOCAL_SCRATCH_DIR="/lustre/${USER}/sparkscratch/"

# SparkWordCount Copy In File
#
# In some cases, a file must be copied in before it can be used.  Most
# notably, this can be the case if the file is not yet in HDFS.
#
# If specified below, the file will be copied to the location
# specified by SPARK_SPARKWORDCOUNT_FILE before the word count is
# executed.  
#
# Specify the scheme appropriately.  At this moment, the schemes of
# file:// and hdfs:// are recognized for this option.
#
# Note that this is not required.  The file could be copied in any
# number of other ways, such as through a previous job or through a
# script specified via MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN.
