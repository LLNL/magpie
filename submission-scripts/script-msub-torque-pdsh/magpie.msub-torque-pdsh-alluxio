# Directory your launching scripts/files are stored
#
# Normally an NFS mount, someplace magpie can be reached on all nodes.
export MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME="${HOME}/magpie"

# Path to store data local to each cluster node, typically something
# in /tmp.  This will store local conf files and log files for your
# job.  If local scratch space is not available, consider using the
# MAGPIE_NO_LOCAL_DIR option.  See README for more details.
#
export MAGPIE_LOCAL_DIR="/tmp/${USER}/magpie"

# Magpie job type
#
# "alluxio" - Run a job according to the settings of ALLUXIO_JOB.
#
# "testall" - Run a job that runs all basic sanity tests for all
#             software that is configured to be setup.  This is a good
#             way to sanity check that everything has been setup
#             correctly and the way you like.
#
#             For Alluxio, testall will run testalluxio
#
# "script" - Run arbitraty script, as specified by MAGPIE_JOB_SCRIPT.
#            You can find example job scripts in examples/.
#
# "interactive" - manually interact with job run to submit jobs,
#                 peruse data (e.g. HDFS), move data, etc.  See job
#                 output for instructions to access your job
#                 allocation.
#
# "setuponly" - do not launch any daemons or services, only setup
#               configuration files.  Useful for debugging or
#               development.
#
export MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE="alluxio"

# Specify script and arguments to execute for "script" mode in
# MAGPIE_JOB_TYPE
#
# export MAGPIE_JOB_SCRIPT="${HOME}/my-job-script"

# Specify script startup / shutdown time window
#
# Specifies the amount of time to give startup / shutdown activities a
# chance to succeed before Magpie will give up (or in the case of
# shutdown, when the resource manager/scheduler may kill the running
# job).  Defaults to 30 minutes for startup, 30 minutes for shutdown.
#
# The startup time in particular may need to be increased if you have
# a large amount of data.  As an example, HDFS may need to spend a
# significant amount of time determine all of the blocks in HDFS
# before leaving safemode.
#
# The stop time in particular may need to be increased if you have a
# large amount of cleanup to be done.  HDFS will save its NameSpace
# before shutting down.  Hbase will do a compaction before shutting
# down.
#
# The startup & shutdown window must together be smaller than the
# timelimit specified for the job.
#
# MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME and MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME at minimum must be 5
# minutes.  If MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN is specified below,
# MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME must be at minimum 10 minutes.
#
# export MAGPIE_STARTUP_TIME=30
# export MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME=30

# Magpie One Time Run
#
# Normally, Magpie assumes that when a user runs a job, data created
# and stored within that job will be desired to be accessed again.  For
# example, data created and stored within HDFS will be accessed again.
#
# Under a number of scenarios, this may not be desired.  For example
# during testing.
#
# To improve useability and performance, setting MAGPIE_ONE_TIME_RUN
# below to yes will have two effects on the Magpie job.
#
# 1) A number of data paths (such as for HDFS) will be put into unique
#    paths for this job.  Therefore, no other job should be able to
#    access the data again.  This is particularly useful if you wish
#    to run performance tests with this job script over and over
#    again.
#
#    Magpie will not remove data that was written, so be sure to clean up
#    your directories later.
#
# 2) In order to improve job throughout, Magpie will take shortcuts by
#    not properly tearing down the job.  As data corruption should not be
#    a concern on job teardown, the job can complete more quickly.
#
# export MAGPIE_ONE_TIME_RUN=yes

# Convenience Scripts
#
# Specify script to be executed to before / after your job.  It is run
# on all nodes.
#
# Typically the pre-job script is used to set something up or get
# debugging info.  It can also be used to determine if system
# conditions meet the expectations of your job.  The primary job
# running script (magpie-run) will not be executed if the
# MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN exits with a non-zero exit code.
#
# The post-job script is typically used for cleaning up something or
# gathering info (such as logs) for post-debugging/analysis.  If it is
# set, MAGPIE_SHUTDOWN_TIME above must be > 5.
#
# See example magpie-example-pre-job-script and
# magpie-example-post-job-script for ideas of what you can do w/ these
# scripts
#
# Multiple scripts can be specified separated by comma.  Arguments can
# be passed to scripts as well.
#
# A number of convenient scripts are available in the
# ${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts directory.
#
# export MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/pre-job-run-scripts/my-pre-job-script"
# export MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/post-job-run-scripts/my-post-job-script"
#
# Similar to the MAGPIE_PRE_JOB_RUN and MAGPIE_POST_JOB_RUN, scripts can be
# run after the stack is setup but prior to the script or interactive mode
# begins. This enables frontends and other processes that depend on the stack
# to be started up and torn down. In similar fashion the cleanup will be done
# immediately after the script or interactive mode exits before the stack is
# shutdown.
#
# export MAGPIE_PRE_EXECUTE_RUN="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/pre-job-run-scripts/my-pre-job-script"
# export MAGPIE_POST_EXECUTE_RUN="${MAGPIE_SCRIPTS_HOME}/scripts/post-job-run-scripts/my-post-job-script"

# Environment Variable Script
#
# When working with Magpie interactively by logging into the master
# node of your job allocation, many environment variables may need to
# be set.  For example, environment variables for config file
# directories (e.g. HADOOP_CONF_DIR, HBASE_CONF_DIR, etc.) and home
# directories (e.g. HADOOP_HOME, HBASE_HOME, etc.) and more general
# environment variables (e.g. JAVA_HOME) may need to be set before you
# begin interacting with your big data setup.
#
# The standard job output from Magpie provides instructions on all the
# environment variables typically needed to interact with your job.
# However, this can be tedious if done by hand.
#
# If the environment variable specified below is set, Magpie will
# create the file and put into it every environment variable that
# would be useful when running your job interactively.  That way, it
# can be sourced easily if you will be running your job interactively.
# It can also be loaded or used by other job scripts.
#
# export MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT="${HOME}/my-job-env"

# Environment Variable Shell Type
#
# Magpie outputs environment variables in help output and
# MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT based on your SHELL environment
# variable.
#
# If you would like to output in a different shell type (perhaps you
# have programmed scripts in a different shell), specify that shell
# here.
#
# export MAGPIE_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_SCRIPT_SHELL="/bin/bash"

# Remote Shell
#
# Magpie requires a passwordless remote shell command to launch
# necessary daemons across your job allocation.  Magpie defaults to
# ssh, but it may be an alternate command in some environments.  An
# alternate ssh-equivalent remote command can be specified by setting
# MAGPIE_REMOTE_CMD below.
#
# If using ssh, Magpie requires keys to be setup ahead of time so it
# can be executed without passwords.
#
# Specify options to the remote shell command if necessary.
#
# export MAGPIE_REMOTE_CMD="ssh"
# export MAGPIE_REMOTE_CMD_OPTS=""

# Alluxio Core Configurations
############################################################################

# Should Alluxio be run
#
# Specify yes or no. Defaults to no.
#
export ALLUXIO_SETUP=yes

# Alluxio Version
#
export ALLUXIO_VERSION="2.3.0"

# Path to your Alluxio build/binaries
#
# This should be accessible on all nodes in your allocation. Typically
# this is in an NFS mount.
#
export ALLUXIO_HOME="${HOME}/alluxio-${ALLUXIO_VERSION}"

# ALLUXIO_WORKER_ON_MASTER
#
# Most big data projects do not have a "worker" that also
# runs on the master node (such as Hadoop, Hbase, etc.). Alluxio is
# an exception in which it often likes to have a worker running on the
# master node for convenience of running tests and such.
#
# It is not required to run a worker on the master, but it can be
# convenient. Specify the below to "yes" to run a worker on the
# master.
#
export ALLUXIO_WORKER_ON_MASTER="yes"

# Path to store data local to each cluster node, typically something
# in /tmp. This will store local conf files and log files for your job.
#
export ALLUXIO_LOCAL_DIR="/tmp/${USER}/alluxio"

# Path to store Alluxio Under File System data
#
# This should point to the path where you store your data
# and have to be accessible on all nodes in your allocation.
# Most likely it would be placed on Lustre, like "/lustre/${USER}/alluxio"
# but also it could be NFS mounted on all Alluxio nodes,
# like "${ALLUXIO_HOME}/underFSStorage",
# or ex. HDFS, like "hdfs://hdfsmaster:9000/alluxio/".
# Check Alluxio documentation for more UnderFS storage options.
#
export ALLUXIO_UNDER_FS_DIR="/lustre/${USER}/alluxio"

# ALLUXIO_DATA_CLEAR
#
# Alluxio has data files that are written to UnderFS and a journal file
# containing metadata so the state of Alluxio filesystem is saved
# and can be reused on multiple Alluxio runs.
#
# This flag enabled forces that data to be wiped which results
# in a clean install of Alluxio every time Magpie runs it.
#
# Specify yes or no. Defaults to yes.
export ALLUXIO_DATA_CLEAR="yes"

# Memory capacity of each worker node
#
# Set the amount of memory each Alluxio worker will use. Memory would
# be used as the first tier of storage. The more memory would Alluxio have,
# the bigger first tier storage would be. Be mindful of the memory
# requirements of other services (e.g. Spark).
#
export ALLUXIO_WORKER_MEMORY_SIZE=16GB

# ALLUXIO_WORKER_TIER0_PATH
#
# Alluxio will use RAM File System as caching storage.
# In this variable, there could be set path for tiered storage level 0.
# Default settings are /mnt/ramdisk on Linux and /Volumes/ramdisk on OSX.
#
# To avoid sudo requirement but using tmpFS in Linux,
# set here /dev/shm and ALLUXIO_RAMFS_MOUNT_OPTION to NoMount option.
export ALLUXIO_WORKER_TIER0_PATH="/mnt/ramdisk"

# ALLUXIO_RAMFS_MOUNT_OPTION
#
# Select option how RamFS should be mounted in Alluxio.
#
# There are 3 mount options for alluxio-start.sh command:
# Mount     - Mount the configured RamFS if it is not already mounted.
# SudoMount - Mount the configured RamFS using sudo
#             if it is not already mounted. This option requires sudo,
#             it should not be used when user doesn't have sudo rights.
# NoMount   - Do not mount the configured RamFS. Also, this option should
#             be used when RamFS is not available.
#
# To avoid sudo requirement but using tmpFS in Linux,
# set ALLUXIO_WORKER_TIER0_PATH to /dev/shm and use here NoMount option.
#
# If you have sudo and have doubts, leave the default value.
export ALLUXIO_RAMFS_MOUNT_OPTION="SudoMount"

# Default read type when creating Alluxio files
#
# Valid options are:
# - CACHE_PROMOTE (move data to highest tier
#   if already in Alluxio storage, write data into highest
#   tier of local Alluxio if data needs to be read from under storage),
# - CACHE (write data into highest tier of local Alluxio
#   if data needs to be read from under storage),
# - NO_CACHE (no data interaction with Alluxio, if the read is from
#   Alluxio data migration or eviction will not occur).
#
export ALLUXIO_READ_TYPE="CACHE"

# Default write type when creating Alluxio files
#
# Valid options are:
# - MUST_CACHE (write will only go to Alluxio and must be stored
#   in Alluxio),
# - CACHE_THROUGH (try to cache, write to UnderFS synchronously),
# - THROUGH (no cache, write to UnderFS synchronously),
# - ASYNC_THROUGH (try to cache, write to UnderFS asynchronously).
#
export ALLUXIO_WRITE_TYPE="CACHE_THROUGH"

# Additional tiered storage levels
#
# To use more storage levels than the default one in memory,
# customize it directly in configuration template file,
# i.e. magpie/conf/alluxio/alluxio-site.properties.
